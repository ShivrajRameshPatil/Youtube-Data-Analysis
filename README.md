# YouTube Data Analysis

This project extracts, processes, and visualizes YouTube data using several technologies: Java, Hadoop, Cassandra, and Power BI. The purpose of this project is to analyze YouTube video data such as views, likes, comments, and channel statistics, process it using big data tools, and present the insights through interactive dashboards.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Extraction**:  
   - Data is extracted from YouTube using the YouTube Data API via a Java application.
   - The extracted data includes video statistics (views, likes, comments) and channel information.

2. **Data Processing**:  
   - The extracted data is processed using Hadoop and MapReduce to handle large datasets efficiently.
   - Data transformations, aggregation, and cleaning are performed during this phase.

3. **Data Storage**:  
   - Processed data is stored in a distributed NoSQL database, Cassandra, ensuring scalability and high availability.

4. **Data Visualization**:  
   - Insights from the processed data are visualized using Power BI, creating interactive dashboards.
